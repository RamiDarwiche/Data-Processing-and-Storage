## Instructions to run code:

1. Create a python virtual environment

```python
python -m venv .venv
```

2.  Activate the virtual environment (command may vary dependent on python version)

```python
source .venv/Scripts/Activate
```

3. Run main.py

```python
python main.py
```

Any code modifications for testing can be done in the main function.

### Assignment recommendations

I think that the current instructions were very clear. However, without making any changes, I would recommend that a coding sandbox is provided to students with many common programming environments made available (like Replit). This would time for both students and graders on dealing with environment preparation. In terms of additional content, I tink that concurrent interactions could be an interesting avenue to explore. This could include some readings on ACID properties and a slightly more complicated assignment with threads and locks (a template might be beneficial for brevity) to get practical experience with them.
